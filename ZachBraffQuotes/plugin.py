quotes = ("I remember once I went to go see a movie, and in front of me in line there was a little boy who looked so eager to see it, like it was Christmas morning.

"If God wanted women to be treated equally to men, he'd have given them penises. - Zach Braff on Women",
"I really don't know why we need a whole month dedicated to blacks. It's not like they're the only ones that suffered. I mean, what about us whites? We're the ones that have to deal with these monkeys everyday, but you don't see us demanding a whole month to ourselves. - Zach Braff on Black history month",
"But I'm alive. - Zach Braff on Friedrich Nietzsche",

"I mean, I understand that because they're disadvantaged that they deserve their own parking spots, but do they have to make them so wide? I never understood how these people were allowed to drive cars but they get these really neat chairs with wheels and they're still not happy, so instead of parking their wheelchairs in the designated spots, they upstage us normal people and get the best parking spots with vehicles that are clearly too sophisticated for them to be handling.

"I like to drop in on people who picked on me in high school or whatever, just out of the blue, and chat with them to see how they think of me now that I'm a big star. Usually they're a lot nicer.

"People always tell me I should run for president, but I don't think they'd give me enough time off to make my films.  - Zach Braff",
"I could see why someone would want to make a website about me, and my quotes. They are all gold. How many people have written, directed AND starred in their own movies.

"I've always preferred Marvel over DC. I just relate to their characters better. I mean look at Wolverine, at first he was just a bit player in an ensemble cast. Now he's the only reason people read X-Men. Just like me and Scrubs. - Zach Braff on comics",
"If you're dumb enough to volunteer for the army, I don't see why we're supposed to feel so bad when you get shot. I'm not saying we should throw a party or anything, but is it such a tragedy? If I'd gotten shot before I made 'Garden State', yeah, that's a tragedy, but some red-state hick getting his legs blown off? Come on. - Zach Braff on the War on Terror",
"It's... it's such a weird thing. After Garden State, so many companies wanted to make my movies, and after The Last Kiss, I realized people would make anything I was in. As long as I keep this up I'll be swimming in chubby indie girl pussy. - Zach Braff on his recent success",
"You know, I've occasionally tried to watch other shows besides Scrubs, but comparing them is a bit like me competing in the special Olympics. Obviously I would win without contest, but the point is that they are trying their best. - Zach Braff on the television industry",

"I've never had much sympathy for orphans, I mean, when I was their age I would have killed to have no parents to make me clean my room and stuff - Zach Braff on orphans",
"Watching John C. McGinley half-ass his lines, probably. Watch Platoon, when he's around Sheen, Dafoe, Berenger. I wouldn't say he's good in it, but you can tell he's trying. It just makes me feel so good to know that I've crushed his work ethic and passion, it's like he knows he'll never be on my level. - Zach Braff on what keeps him going in life",

"Hitler had the right idea. He was just an underachiever. - Zach Braff on genocide",

"I'm far bigger than he ever was. I probably have a longer lifespan, too. - Zach Braff on Oscar Wilde",

It gives people a chance to hope that they can become as great as me someday. - Zach Braff on New Year's resolutions",
"I don't know why people were so upset with me. Prince got his own symbol. I just wanted to adopt the handicap symbol as my own so I could park in handicap spots.

"I'm not 'for it' because I think it's sometimes necessary, I just find them really funny. - Zach Braff on abortions",
"I once looked in the mirror at myself and noticed that, without a doubt, I am a sexy man. In fact, I don't think I'll ever get married...it just wouldn't be fair for my spouse to catch me enjoying a look in the mirror more than having sex with her. - Zach Braff on managing vanity",
"I really don't like doing it, you know? It just feels like the world is losing millions of opportunities for a better quality of life every time I do. I don't want humanity to lose the second most influential director of all time to some sock. - Zach Braff on masturbation",

"Lots of people were giving me flak when I made the deal to do the very last season of Scrubs for $350,000 an episode. When really I'm the one that's being cheated, because the writer's strike is keeping me from all the money that I could be making. I need to eat, too. - Zach Braff on his salary",
"In my opinion, one of the biggest drawbacks about Sergio Leone films are the scores composed by Ennio Morricone. If [Leone] were as talented as I am, he would have made mixtapes for his movies instead of letting some schmuck write the soundtracks for him. But then if he were as talented as I am, he'd be Zach Braff. And have his own Grammy. - Zach Braff on directors less talented than he is",

"People have called me fake, but personally, I don't think I'm fake because I'm so insincere. - Zach Braff",

"Rosa Parks didn't call shotgun. - Zach Braff on civil rights",

"Probably the most memorable even of my life is when I was born. It really made me who I am. If I die, I hope to go out the same way I came in, but I don't think my mother would be into that. - Zach Braff on Memories.",
"It's not terrible, I guess, but if Ricky Gervais was half as talented as me, maybe the show would actually be funny once in a while.  - Zach Braff on The Office",
"I think there are bound to be obstacles in any path to success. I mean, I'm Jewish, and there's nothing I can do about that. Instead of sitting around and feeling sorry for myself, I got over it and did something with my life. - Zach Braff on motivation",
"I've had to remove all mirrors from my home.  I just can't seem to look at myself without having to buff the bishop, you know? - Zach Braff on autosexuality",
"Some people just don't want to put in the effort. I just show up and say some lines and I'm famous. Anyone living below the poverty line just needs to shape up or be shipped out, you know? - Zach Braff on effort",

"I experimented in College like most kids. - Zach Braff on rape",
"I know that [Mike] Tyson talked about wanting to eat his opponent's children, but I don't think he ever had the balls to do it. I'm different - when I kidnapped Bill Lawrence's daughter, I cut off all of her fingers before sending my demands so that I wouldn't have to sit there and wait for him to ignore them. We worked things about about nine hours in, which is good because I ate her thumb as a midnight snack. - Zach Braff on his contract negotiations for the sixth season of Scrubs",

"Sure my penis cures cancer . . . but I don't screw bald chicks - Zach Braff",
"I think we have to acknowledge that people are different and succeed at different things, first of all. Men are better than women at some professions like firefighting, construction work, and physics. But women are better than men at some professions, too, like elementary teaching, prostitution, and giving birth. Who's to say which is more important? - Zach Braff on gender equality",
"I don't do interviews anymore. I mean, any asshole with a pen and paper can write down what I say, but only someone like Hemingway can understand what I'm really saying, you know? - Zach Braff on inteviews",

"My dog has a cough. If you've never seen a dog with a cough, I recommend trying to find one. It's hilarious. - Zach Braff",
"I think they're bogus, honestly. How utter garbage like Crash and Million Dollar Baby can win best picture, where true works of art such as Garden State go untouched is beyond me. It just proves how close-minded America really is, and I refuse to take part in it. - Zach Braff on the Academy Awards",
"I mean, look he may be sexy. He may be able to unleash the dragon but has he ever directed a movie? No. Has he ever been the star of a hit TV series? No. He's great but he's not ZACH BRAFF great. - Zach Braff on Rex Grossman",

"I mean, who can blame him? I love the idea. He's an innovator. - Zach Braff on polygamy",

"When you're the director and the writer, you never have to remember your lines, and there's no one to call you on it. On Garden State I did different lines on every take, just making shit up. And it was great each time. - Zach Braff on acting, writing, and directing",
"Yea, I've got a dream too.  It involves time-travel and a rifle. - Zach Braff on Martin Luther King Jr.",
"The best part of being famous is being able to make people's lives a little better just by mine and theirs intersecting. For example, I love having sex with married women because, hey, they get to have sex with Zach Braff. But then when their husbands inevitably catch me doubling their wives' twats with my enormous cock, the husbands get the pleasure of knowing their dick has been the same place as Zach Braff's. And if they're really lucky, they'll raise or find out they're raising one of my bastard offspring. Sometimes serving others is its own reward, you know?  - Zach Braff on selflessness",
"I can't watch the news anymore. They have their priorities all out of whack. All I see is Natalee Holloway and Britney Spears and the war in Iraq. Where's the substantive news? Where's the Zach Braff coverage? - Zach Braff on the media",

"I actually don't have a big problem getting decent chicks. I'm charming, and know some slick moves. If you like a cashier in a gas station, buy a lottery ticket. When she asks what kind, say Pick your favorite one. She goes to hand you the ticket you tell her Keep it. Maybe you'll get lucky. Then leave. Talk right, and you can get that chick.  - Zach Braff on his love life.",

"I find it hard to believe that so many people doubt the existence of God.  I mean, seriously, I'm here, so is it such a stretch to imagine that another all-powerful being could exist somewhere in the universe? - Zach Braff on God",
"Shortly after writing, directing, and starring in Garden Sate. I was driving and I was crossing an intersection. Just as soon as I had passed it, the man in the car behind me was hit and killed by someone running the red light. I thought to myself, Man just a few seconds earlier and that would have been me.
